About - 
An app to track user habits
A user can add a habit with either daily or weekly tracking. Steps - 
- select a habit
- select frequency (daily/weekly)
- select number of times habit must be tracked ( habit value )
NOTE: some habits can be tracked on basis of completion only ( completed or not completed )

A calendar view is given to change the current date and habit cards are provided to display streak with tracking frequency

Clicking on habit card takes user on the habit details where user can either set the value of the habit for that current day or edit the habit value

NOTE - for streaks functionality to properly work, days must be navigated without skipping the days when moving forward in the calendar as the habit must be tracked daily ( to emulate real life behaviour where user can't skip a day )
